Testing for CSS selectors

The testing file above shows a simple testing procedure for finding CSS selectors. There is still much to be updated in this repository on Selenium so stay around. 

## Major Terms in CSS Selectors
- DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

- XPath: A query language for selecting nodes from an XML document

- CSS Selector: In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

- Functional testing: The process of quality assurance of a product that assumes the testing of the functions/functionalities of a component or system in general, according to specification requirements.

- UI testing: User Interface testing. In other words, you have to make sure that all buttons, fields, labels and other elements on the screen work as stated in a specification.
- Screenshot Testing - A technique used by end-to-end testing which captures a screenshot from a URL and then compares the result with an expected image.


## Steps In Using Selenium To Test
- Try writing a CSS Selector for the magnifying glass after the search box
- Validate this CSS by using the console in the web browser.
- Then, use this CSS selector in the Selenium test to click the magnifying glass.
- A different page should be loaded with 1 search result.
